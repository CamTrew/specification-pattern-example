# Specification Pattern Example
## Scenario 
Our local football team has been accepting online applications to join the team. Unfortunately, not all of the applicants are valid. To be eligible for the team, the applicant must meet the following criteria: 
- Be over 18 years old.
- Be male. 
- Have no health issues.
- Live in London.

We need to write a Go application which can filter out all of the invalid applicants. While it is possible to accomplish this task without using the specification pattern, this should provide a good example.

## How To Run
Run the application with the following command:
```bash
go run main.go
```
